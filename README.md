# Detecting-Malware-and-Unauthorized-Devices

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this lab is to gain an understanding of security risks related to rogue devices and malware through the exploration of active and passive scanning methods.
<br />
Key Learning Outcomes:
<br />
1. Perform both active and passive scanning techniques using Nmap.
<br />
2. Identify rogue devices on the network through the utilization of active and passive tools.
<br />
3. Develop, deploy, and detect malware in a networked environment.
<br />
<h2>Explanation</h2>
This lab focuses on network security by addressing the risks associated with rogue devices and malware. It introduces tools like ifconfig, Nmap, arp-scan, Wireshark, keyloggers, Kali Linux with Metasploit, and DarkComet malware. Through this experience, you will identify networks, detect rogue devices, analyze network traffic, understand keyloggers, explore security testing tools, and craft, deploy, as well as detect malware. This hands-on learning experience aims to enhance your cybersecurity skills, making you proficient in network defense and security assessments.<p>

<h2>Determining the network Range</h2>
Begin by starting up the Kali Linux machine in the network topology. On this Kali system, all three of the company's networks are accessible. 
<br/>
My task is to identify any unauthorized machines on the network by using a blend of active and passive scanning tools. 
<br/>
<br />
ifconfig: <br/>

<br />
<br />
ifconfig eth0 will identify the IP address of the first network:  <br/>
<br />
ifconfig eth1 will identify the IP address of the second network:  <br/>
<br />
ifconfig eth2 will identify the IP address of the third network:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Below is a summary of the three networks that are connected to the Kali system.
 <br />
 Network 1 = 192.168.1.0/24
 <br />
 Network 2 = 172.16.1.0/24
 <br />
 Network 3 = 10.0.0.0/24
 <br />
 <br />
Active and passive Scanning
<br/>
First I will focus on the network segment labeled Network 1:

<br />
<br /> 
ifconfig eth0: <br/>
Next, ping 192.168.1.1 -c 4: Which is pinging the firewall: <br/>
where -c 4: will send 4 ICMP echo requests to IP address 192.168.1.1 <br/>

<br />
<br /> 
ping 192.168.1.175 -c 4: Which is pinging the Windows 8.1 Workstation: <br/>
where -c 4: will send 4 ICMP echo requests to IP address 192.168.1.175 <br/>

<br />
Double-click on the LOIC.exe and start up the Low Orbit ION Cannon Software:  <br/>

 <br />
 <br />
 The Low Orbit ION Cannon is configured to TCP Flood the Linux machine. The selected target is set to the IP address of the Pfense router:  <br/>

 <br />
 <br />
Return to the Linux sniffer click ctl+c and observe packets captured from the TCP flood:

 <br/>
 <h2>Explanation</h2>
 Also, run the command Capinfos TCPcapture.cap
 <br/>
 The `capinfos` command tells you details about a captured network file (like `TCPcapture.cap`). 
  <br/>
 It shows information like when the capture started, how many packets were recorded, which network interfaces were used, and more. 
  <br/>
 It helps you understand what's inside the capture file.
  <br/>
 The following steps are repeated to create a UDP Flood and HTTP Flood attack on the network and captured by the Linux sniffer.
